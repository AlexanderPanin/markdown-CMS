# ↓markdown↓ CMS

A simple, fast, lean, flat file (no database) CMS for easy and quick website generation and publishing. If you can type text you can build a website.

## Requirements

A HTTP server (e.g. Apache) with PHP installed - that's all. Great for low cost hosting plans.

## Install

Drop [the code](http://one-eye.net/downloads/markdown-cms.zip "↓markdown↓ CMS Zip Fle") on the web server. Just extract the zip contents to the public HTML root folder (if using the GitHub zip file everything in the first folder). ↓markdown↓ CMS will now run (e.g. example.com/md).

## Add Files

Folder and files are structure and content. Start by creating an **index.md** file in the root. Add **.md** files for more web pages:

* _index.md_ for **example.com**
* _apage.md_ for **example.com/apage**
* _sub/page.md_ for **example.com/sub/page**

## Set Site Name and Logo

Copy **md-config.php** from the **md** folder into the website root folder and rename it **site-config.php**. Set the values for the site name and logo.
